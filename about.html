        👋 Hey there! I'm Bhupendra Negi, and I like to think of myself as a digital wizard weaving magic through lines of code.
        <p>
          🚀 My journey into the world of software engineering began during my school days when I embarked on a quest to create a school management system using Java. Little did I know that this initial spark would ignite a lifelong passion for coding, problem-solving.

          📚 Fast forward to my college days, I decided to dive headfirst into the world of computer science and technology. With each line of code I wrote, I uncovered the intricate logic behind crafting applications. During this journey, I also explored the world of Android app development, building applications that included useful tools like calculators and music players.
