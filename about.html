        Hi, my name is Bhupendra Negi and I'm a software engineer. 
        </br>
        <p>
          My first introduction to programming was during a project in my school, where I build a school management system using java, then I was hooked.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Then I took forword my journey and pursued BTech in computer science engineer where I developed intrest in build appliactions and started exploring the logic the behind creating an applications.
          Then one thing led to the another and I end up building Mobile Applications using android studio, while learning android development I build simple android applications like calculator, music player etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that I started exploring web developement and started building small web applications.
          By the time I finished my Degree I got my first job as Software Engineer and started building web applications using a Ruby on Rails and react.
        </p>
