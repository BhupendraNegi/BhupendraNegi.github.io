title: Fancy Emails With MJML
---

-------
In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital world, email marketing has become a vital part of business communication. Whether itâ€™s a promotional campaign, a newsletter, or a product update, having an attractive and responsive email can make a big difference. But creating fancy emails that look good across different devices and email clients can be a headache. This is where MJML comes to the rescue.

##### What is MJML?
MJML (Mailjet Markup Language) is an open-source framework designed to help developers create responsive and visually appealing emails. Itâ€™s a powerful tool that makes crafting emails simpler, faster, and more efficient. Instead of dealing with messy HTML and complicated CSS for different email clients, MJML allows you to focus on content while the framework takes care of the layout and responsiveness.

##### Why Do You Need MJML?
`Responsive Design Made Easy:` MJMLâ€™s key strength is its ability to create emails that automatically adapt to various screen sizes. It ensures that your emails look great on both desktops and mobile devices without the need for complicated media queries.

`Cross-Client Compatibility:` Emails often render differently across email clients (Gmail, Outlook, etc.). MJMLâ€™s framework handles the inconsistencies across these platforms, ensuring a consistent look.

`Simplified Markup:` Writing email HTML can be complex, especially when you're trying to make the design responsive. MJML simplifies this by using an easy-to-read syntax, so you donâ€™t have to worry about writing lengthy CSS or intricate HTML tags.

`Faster Development:` MJML speeds up the design process because it abstracts away the repetitive and challenging parts of coding for emails. It generates clean, optimized HTML thatâ€™s ready to be sent.

`Open Source:` MJML is free to use, and itâ€™s continuously updated by a community of developers.


##### How Does MJML Work?
MJML works by letting you write in a custom markup language thatâ€™s easier to understand than traditional HTML. You then use the MJML engine (available as an online tool, Node.js library, or even through plugins for different code editors) to compile it into responsive HTML code ready for emails.

Letâ€™s break down the structure a little. MJML has tags like  `<mj-section>, <mj-column>, <mj-text>,` and `<mj-button>`  to create sections, columns, text blocks, and buttons. You donâ€™t need to worry about complex CSS to make these elements look good on different devices.

##### MJML Example:
Letâ€™s take a look at a professional, well-designed email using MJML, perfect for a Product Launch or Special Offer campaign. This example will demonstrate how to create an engaging, visually appealing email with clear branding, a call-to-action, and mobile responsiveness.
