title: Solid Queue With Rails
---

-------

In a world where applications need to handle thousands of tasks efficiently, job queues are the unsung heroes. They help process background tasks, ensuring your application stays responsive while heavy lifting happens in the background. One such solution that stands out is Solid Queue.

##### Why Solid Queue is Fast

`1. Lightweight and Minimal Overhead:` Solid Queue avoids unnecessary complexity by focusing on core job queuing. Its lightweight design ensures it has minimal impact on your system resources. Unlike some heavy queuing systems, Solid Queue doesn’t add extra bloat to your stack.

`2. Concurrency and Parallelism:` Solid Queue uses Ruby’s threading capabilities effectively. It allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, ensuring maximum CPU utilization without bottlenecks. This design makes it ideal for high-throughput applications.

`3. In-Memory Queuing:` By default, Solid Queue operates in memory, making task enqueueing and dequeueing extremely fast. For production use, it supports integration with persistent storage like Redis or a database, ensuring job durability.

`4. Customizable Workers:` Solid Queue lets you define workers that can be tuned for specific tasks, enabling you to optimize resource allocation and processing efficiency.

`5. Retry Mechanism:` `Built-in support for retrying failed jobs ensures that transient errors don’t disrupt task processing. This reliability feature enhances application stability.

##### How Solid Queue Works

Solid Queue operates on a producer-consumer model: This separation ensures that heavy tasks don’t block the main application, keeping your users happy with fast responses.

`Producer:` Rails application enqueues tasks (jobs) into the queue.

`Queue:` Tasks are stored in memory or a persistent storage backend.

`Consumer:` Worker threads fetch and execute tasks from the queue.



##### Implementation

##### Install the Gem

```ruby
gem 'solid_queue'
```

```ruby
bundle install
```

##### Configure Solid Queue

Create an initializer file to set up Solid Queue. For example, config/initializers/solid_queue.rb:

```ruby
SolidQueue.configure do |config|
  config.worker_count = 5  # Number of concurrent workers
  config.logger = Rails.logger  # Use Rails' logger for job logs
  config.retry_attempts = 3  # Retry failed jobs 3 times
end
```
Here, you configure the number of workers (threads), logging, and retry attempts. You can add more configurations based on your application’s needs.


##### Define Your Jobs

Create a directory for your jobs (e.g., app/jobs). Then, define your job classes. Each job must implement a perform method:
```ruby
class MyBackgroundJob
  def perform(data)
    # Simulate a background task
    Rails.logger.info "Processing data: #{data}"
    # Example task: Send an email or process a file
    UserMailer.welcome_email(data[:user_id]).deliver_now
  end
end
```

You can define as many job classes as needed for different tasks. Each job encapsulates the logic for a specific background task.

Adding Job with Complex Logic

For tasks with multiple steps, break down the logic into helper methods:

```ruby
class ComplexJob
  def perform(data)
    Rails.logger.info "Starting complex job for data: #{data}"
    step_one(data)
    step_two(data)
    Rails.logger.info "Completed complex job for data: #{data}"
  end

  private

  def step_one(data)
    # Perform the first step
    Rails.logger.info "Step one with: #{data[:step_one_info]}"
  end

  def step_two(data)
    # Perform the second step
    Rails.logger.info "Step two with: #{data[:step_two_info]}"
  end
end
```
This structure ensures that your code remains readable and maintainable.

##### Enqueue Jobs

You can enqueue jobs from controllers, models, or services. Here’s an example from a controller:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)

    if @user.save
      # Enqueue a background job
      SolidQueue.enqueue(MyBackgroundJob.new, data: { user_id: @user.id })

      # Enqueue a complex job
      SolidQueue.enqueue(ComplexJob.new, data: { step_one_info: "info1", step_two_info: "info2" })

      redirect_to @user, notice: 'User was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :password, :password_confirmation)
  end
end
```
Here, both a simple and a complex job are triggered after a user is successfully created.

##### Start the Workers

Solid Queue includes a worker manager to process jobs. Start the workers using the Rails runner:
```ruby
rails runner "SolidQueue.start"
```

Example Worker Output
When a job runs, you might see logs like this:

```bash
[Worker-1] Processing job: MyBackgroundJob with data: {:user_id=>42}
[Worker-2] Processing job: ComplexJob with data: {:step_one_info=>"info1", :step_two_info=>"info2"}
[Worker-1] Completed job: MyBackgroundJob
[Worker-2] Completed job: ComplexJob
```

For development, you can also start the workers manually. In production, integrate it with process managers like foreman, systemd, or Docker.

##### Monitor Your Queue

Monitor your jobs to ensure smooth operation. You can log queue length and worker utilization or use monitoring tools for deeper insights. For example:

Rails.logger.info "Current queue length: #{SolidQueue.queue_length}"

Implementing a Monitoring Job

You can create a job to monitor and alert on queue health:

```ruby
class QueueMonitoringJob
  def perform
    length = SolidQueue.queue_length
    if length > 10
      Rails.logger.warn "High queue length: #{length}"
    end
  end
end
```

Schedule this job to run periodically using a cron scheduler like whenever or a similar tool.

##### Handling Failures

Solid Queue provides robust mechanisms to handle job failures. Here’s how you can leverage them:

##### Retry Logic

Solid Queue automatically retries failed jobs based on the retry_attempts configuration. You can also implement custom retry logic in your job class:

```ruby
class ResilientJob
  def perform(data)
    begin
      # Perform a task that might fail
      process_data(data)
    rescue StandardError => e
      Rails.logger.error "Job failed: #{e.message}"
      raise e  # Re-raise to trigger a retry
    end
  end

  private

  def process_data(data)
    # Example: Make an API call
    RestClient.get(data[:url])
  end
end
```

##### Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

For jobs that fail even after retries, you can implement a dead letter queue to store them for further inspection.

```ruby
SolidQueue.configure do |config|
  config.dead_letter_handler = ->(job, error) {
    Rails.logger.error "Job permanently failed: #{job.inspect}, Error: #{error.message}"
    FailedJob.create(job_data: job, error_message: error.message)
  }
end
```

This ensures no job is lost, even in the event of persistent failures.

Inspecting Failed Jobs

You can build a simple admin interface to inspect failed jobs:

```ruby
class FailedJobsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @failed_jobs = FailedJob.all
  end

  def retry
    failed_job = FailedJob.find(params[:id])
    SolidQueue.enqueue(eval(failed_job.job_data))
    failed_job.destroy
    redirect_to failed_jobs_path, notice: "Job retried successfully."
  end
end
```


##### Best Practices with Solid Queue
`Use Idempotent Jobs:` Ensure that your jobs can run multiple times without adverse effects. For example, check for the existence of a record before creating it.

`Prioritize and Categorize Jobs:` Use job priorities or categories to ensure critical tasks are executed first while others are queued.

`Monitor Performance:` Keep an eye on job metrics like execution time, retries, and failures. These insights will help you optimize job efficiency.

`Scale Wisely:` Adjust worker counts dynamically based on load using tools like Kubernetes for autoscaling or dedicated process managers.

`Handle Failures Gracefully:` Use retry and dead letter queue mechanisms effectively to recover from transient errors while identifying systemic issues.

`Log Strategically:` Avoid excessive logging, especially for high-frequency tasks, to prevent log bloat while still capturing essential job execution details.
